		<p>The final project for this unit will be to create professional Entre websites.  Therefore, we want to work on ...</p>

		<ul>
		    <li>Adding consistent style to webpages </li>
		    <li>Organizing websites with multiple webpages </li>
		    <li>Creating complete websites with meaningful content</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I also want to share the helpful feedback that I received from you and respond to some of your ideas.  My responses are in <r>italics</r>.</p>

		<h3> You liked ... </h3>
		<ul>
		    <li> Showing your personality. <r>For our next project you will get to choose the topic of your website.</r> </li>
		    <li> The "freedom of playing around in HTML". <r>Lots more of this heading your way!</r> </li>
		    <li> Having a template to work from.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> You thought that in the future, it would be great if ... </h3>
		<ul>
		    <li> Work time was quieter. <r>Let's all be more aware of how much noise we're making during class and ensure that everyone can work productively.
		   	I'm also going to dedicate a portion of the room as a quiet working space.  More on this next time. </r> </li>
		    <li> Instructions were clear and displayed somewhere. </li>
		    <li> More time for activities. <r>Unfortunately, there is only so much we can do in 90 minutes.  Stop by at OH for more CS!</r></li>
