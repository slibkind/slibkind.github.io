        <h1> SOPHIE LIBKIND </h1>

        <p> I am a first year math PhD student  at Stanford University.  Some words that get me excited include: dynamics, computation, information, ergodicity, coarse-graining, category theory, time, and strucutre. I would love to understand how small interacting parts (atoms, neurons,  people) create a unified, agentic whole (the universe, me, the economy). </p>


        <p>
        I  think a lot of about teaching and education. Between my Masters degree and PhD, I taught middle school computer science and a math class on combinatorics and number systems. Currently, I work with <a href = "http://youcubed.org/"
        > Jo Boaler</a> on math(s) education and am a teaching assistant.
