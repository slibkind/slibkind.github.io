    <h1>Entre Websites</h1>
        <p>At the end of this project I will assess you on 
        <ol>
            <li>Your contributions to the website design.  This includes participating in the group discussions and 
            decision making as well as making compromises when necessary.</li>
            <li>The quality of your CSS code. Code that you type should be written under your name in the .css files.
            I expect you to make valuable contributions to the CSS code and also allow other members of your team to shine.</li>
            <li>The quality of your HTML code. You will be responsible for the HTML of a webpage.  This is your opportunity to 
            show me what you can do.</li>
        </ol>
